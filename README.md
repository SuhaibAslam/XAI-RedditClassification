# Classifying social media posts using explainable artificial intelligence

* This project involved classifying the r/CasualConversation subreddit's posts by tags that relate to their topics. Several machine learning classification models were tested for conducting the flair classification taskâ€“with a focus on explainability. A robust, generalizable classifier (94% accuracy) was built using natural language processing and non-black-box machine learning. The classifier can be expanded upon by retraining using an updated dataset that contains a greater quantity and diversity of flairs.

* r-CasualConversation filtering JSON database: filters a large quanity of JSONs for use in the project

* CasualConversations Flair Classification: [MAIN FILE] trains, tests and evaluates various machine learning models that are based on various feature combinations, which classify the CasualConversation posts based on flairs

* Both of the above files are given as html and ipynb
